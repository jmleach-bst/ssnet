<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `ssnet` is to fit spike-and-slab elastic net GLM’s with or
without spatially structured priors. The package is in development, so
we’re still working bugs and so forth.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of ssnet from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->

<!-- install.packages("ssnet") -->

<!-- ``` -->

The `R` package `ssnet` is in development, which version can be
installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jmleach-bst/ssnet")
```

## Example

Coming soon - examples and vignette.
