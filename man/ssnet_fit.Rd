\arguments{
\item{x}{Design, or input, matrix, of dimension nobs x nvars; each row is an observation vector. It is recommended that
\code{x} have user-defined column names for ease of identifying variables. If missing \code{colnames} are internally
assigned \code{x1}, \code{x2}, ... and so forth.}

\item{y}{Scalar response variable. Quantitative for \code{family = "gaussian"}, or \code{family = "poisson"}
(non-negative counts). For \code{family = "gaussian"}, \code{y} is always standardized. For \code{family = "binomial"},
y should be either a factor with two levels, or a two-column matrix of counts or proportions (the second column is treated
as the target class; for a factor, the last level in alphabetical order is the target class). For \code{family="cox"}, \code{y}
should be a two-column matrix with columns named \code{'time'} and \code{'status'}. The latter is a binary variable, with \code{'1'}
indicating death, and \code{'0'} indicating right censored. The function \code{Surv()} in package survival produces such a matrix.}

\item{family}{Response type (see above).}

\item{offset}{A vector of length \code{nobs} that is included in the linear predictor.}

\item{epsilon}{A positive convergence tolerance; the iterations converge when \eqn{|dev - dev_old|/(|dev| + 0.1) < e}.}

\item{alpha}{A scalar value between 0 and 1 determining the compromise between the Ridge and Lasso models. When
\code{alpha = 1} reduces to the Lasso, and when \code{alpha = 0} reduces to Ridge.}

\item{maxit}{An integer giving the maximal number of EM iterations.}

\item{init}{A vector of initial values for all coefficients (not for intercept). If not given, it will be internally produced.}

\item{group}{A numeric vector, or an integer, or a list indicating the groups of predictors.
If \code{group = NULL}, all the predictors form a single group. If \code{group = K}, the
predictors are evenly divided into groups each with K predictors. If group is a numberic vector,
it defines groups as follows: Group 1: \code{(group[1]+1):group[2]}, Group 2: \code{(group[2]+1):group[3]},
Group 3: \code{(group[3]+1):group[4]}, ... If group is a list of variable names, \code{group[[k]]}
includes variables in the k-th group. The mixture double-exponential prior is only used for grouped
predictors. For ungrouped predictors, the prior is double-exponential with scale \code{ss[2]} and mean 0.}

\item{ss}{A vector of two positive scale values for the spike-and-slab mixture double-exponential prior, allowing for different
scales for different predictors, leading to different amount of shrinkage. Smaller scale values give stronger shrinkage. While
the smaller of the two input values will be treated as the spike scale, it is recommended to specify the spike scale as the
first element of the vector.}

\item{Warning}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, shows the error messages of not convergence and identifiability.}

\item{iar.prior}{Logical. When \code{TRUE}, imposes intrinsic autoregressive prior on logit of the probabilities of
inclusion. When \code{FALSE}, treats probabilties of inclusion as unstructured.}

\item{adjmat}{A data.frame or matrix containing a "sparse" representation of the neighbor relationships. The first
column should contain a numerical index for a given location. Each index will be repeated in this column for
every neighbor it has. The indices for the location's neighbors are then specified in the second column. An optional
third column specifies weights. If no third column is specified, then equal weights are assumed.}

\item{iar.data}{A list of output from \code{\link{mungeCARdata4stan}} that contains the necessary
inputs for the IAR prior. When unspecified, this is built internally assuming that neighbors are those
variables directly above, below, left, and  right of a given variable location. \code{im.res} must be specified
when allowing this argument to be built internally. It is not recommended to use this argument directly, even
when specifying a more complicated neighborhood stucture; this can be specified with the \code{adjmat} argument,
and then internally converted to the correct format.}

\item{tau.prior}{One of \code{c("none", "manual", "cauchy")}. This argument determines the precision
parameter in the Conditional Autoregressive model for the (logit of) prior inclusion probabilities.
When \code{"none"}, the precision is set to 1; when "manual", the precision is manually entered by the
use; when \code{"cauchy"}, the inverse precision is assumed to follow a Cauchy distribution with mean 0 and
scale 2.5.}

\item{stan_manual}{A \code{stan_model} that is manually specified. Especially when fitting multiple models in
succession, specifying the the \code{stan} model outside this "loop" may avoid errors.}

\item{opt.algorithm}{One of \code{c("LBFGS", "BFGS", "Newton")}. This argument determines which argument
is used to optimize the term in the EM algorithm that estimates the probabilities of inclusion for
each parameter. Optimization is performed by \code{optimizing}.}

\item{p.bound}{A vector defining the lower and upper boundaries for the probabilities of inclusion
in the model, respectively. Defaults to \code{c(0.01, 0.99)}.}

\item{plot.pj}{When \code{TRUE}, prints a series of 2D graphs of the prior probabilities of inclusion
at each step of the algorithm. This should NOT be used for 3D data.}

\item{im.res}{A 2-element vector where the first argument is the number of "rows" and the second argument
is the number of "columns" in each subject's "image". Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
The fitted model for the spike-and-slab elastic net. An object of class \code{c("elnet", "glmnet"}.

\description{
Fit the Spike-and-Slab Elastic Net GLM with Intrinsic Autoregressive Prior
}
\note{
Currently, the \code{ssnet()} \code{im.res} can only handle 2D data. Future versions may allow
images to be 3D. However, the function will work given any appropriately specified neighborhood matrix,
whatever the original dimension.
