\title{Prepare the model for analysis.}
\usage{
prepare(x, intercept, prior.mean, prior.sd, prior.scale, prior.df, group)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The design, or input, matrix, of dimension nobs x nvars; each row is an observation vector.}

\item{intercept}{Logical. When \code{intercept = TRUE}, an intercept is includedi in the model.}

\item{prior.mean}{A vector of prior means for the parameters. If \code{length(prior.mean) = 1}, then
all parameters are assumed to have a common prior mean.}

\item{prior.sd}{A vector defining prior standard deviations in the normal priors of the coefficients.
If provided, they are starting values of the prior standard deviations for the iterative algorithms.
This argument is used within the function \code{bglm()}.If \code{length(prior.sd) = 1}, then
all parameters are assumed to have a common prior standard deviation.}

\item{prior.scale}{A vector containing the prior scale values for double exponential or t prior.
In the spike-and-slab lasso model, this is generally only the slab prior scale.}

\item{prior.df}{A scalar defining the prior degrees of freedom when the t-distribution is used
as a prior for the parameters.}

\item{group}{A numeric vector, or an integer, or a list indicating the groups of predictors.
If \code{group = NULL}, all the predictors form a single group. If \code{group = K}, the
predictors are evenly divided into groups each with K predictors. If group is a numberic vector,
it defines groups as follows: Group 1: \code{(group[1]+1):group[2]}, Group 2: \code{(group[2]+1):group[3]},
Group 3: \code{(group[3]+1):group[4]}, ... If group is a list of variable names, \code{group[[k]]}
includes variables in the k-th group. The mixture double-exponential prior is only used for grouped
predictors. For ungrouped predictors, the prior is double-exponential with scale \code{ss[2]} and mean 0.}
